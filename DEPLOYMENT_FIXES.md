# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issue Resolved
Fixed Netlify deployment showing black screen instead of the basketball game.

## Root Cause
The `netlify.toml` configuration was incorrectly set to deploy from the root directory (`.`) instead of building and deploying the React application from the `client` folder.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated netlify.toml
**Before:**
```toml
[build]
  command = ""
  publish = "."
```

**After:**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist/public"
```

### 2. Verified Build Process
- Confirmed `npm run build` successfully compiles the React app
- Verified output directory `dist/public` contains the complete game
- Tested that all game assets (textures, sounds, fonts) are properly included

## Deployment Process
1. Netlify will now run `npm run build` 
2. This compiles the React app using Vite
3. Built files are output to `dist/public`
4. Netlify serves the compiled game from this directory

## Files Modified
- `netlify.toml` - Updated build configuration
- `.local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md` - Migration tracking

## Result
Your basketball game "Nate The Great - Blockchain Basketball" will now deploy correctly to Netlify with:
- Proper theme system (Solana, Cyber, Ocean themes)
- Functional Phaser.js game engine
- Complete leaderboard system
- All game assets and sounds

## Next Steps for GitHub Update
1. Add all modified files: `git add .`
2. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Fix Netlify deployment configuration - resolve black screen issue"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
