# Final Netlify Deployment Fix

## Problem Analysis
The Netlify build is failing because:
1. The original Vite config uses Replit-specific plugins not available in Netlify
2. The build process needs to exclude server-side dependencies
3. Sharp package and other Node.js modules need proper externalization

## Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Netlify-Specific Vite Configuration
**File: `vite.config.netlify.ts`**
- Removed Replit-specific `runtimeErrorOverlay` plugin
- Added proper externalization for server-side packages
- Configured optimizeDeps to exclude problematic packages

### 2. Updated Netlify Build Configuration
**File: `netlify.toml`**
```toml
[build]
  command = "npx vite build --config vite.config.netlify.ts"
  publish = "dist/public"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

### 3. Added Node Version Lock
**File: `.nvmrc`**
- Ensures consistent Node.js version (18) across deployments

### 4. Sharp Package Integration
- Sharp package properly added to dependencies
- Configured as external in Rollup options to prevent build issues

## Files Modified/Created:
- `vite.config.netlify.ts` - New Netlify-specific build config
- `netlify.toml` - Updated build commands
- `.nvmrc` - Node version specification
- `netlify-build-complete.sh` - Alternative build script
- Package dependencies updated with sharp

## Build Process:
1. Netlify installs dependencies (including sharp)
2. Uses Netlify-specific Vite config (excludes Replit plugins)
3. Builds only the React client app
4. Outputs to `dist/public` directory
5. Deploys static React basketball game

## Expected Result:
Your basketball game will deploy successfully on Netlify without build errors or black screen issues.
